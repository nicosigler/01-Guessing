# 01-Guessing
This is my first project for C220. The purpose of this game is for me to learn how to use simple data types and control structures

The player is tasked with guessing a random number within a range that I programmed into the game. It lets people guess the number till they get the correct answer. Once they guess the number it will ask them if they would like to play again.
